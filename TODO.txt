https://github.com/pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph/issues/1381

** General **

- Look into tab focus
- Write help for each instrument
- Add overall README file
- Add error checking to opening resource and other VISA accesses
- Add controllable parameters to each instrument (e.g. voltage and current level)

** Acquisition **

- Implement better way to handle breaks between time sequences instead of just inserting
  a dummy NaN. Maybe separate lists of measurements that are then stitched together?
  Right now if there's a segment with only one measurement it isn't drawn.
- Bug - Closing an instrument doesn't start a new segment so when the instrument is
  reopened it just has a big jump from the previous elapsed time (when there's only
  one instrument).
- Load from CSV
- Real-time save to CSV
- Replay recording in real time or sped up / slowed down

** XY Plotting **

- Bug - sharing Y axis doesn't refresh the position of the Y axis label
- Bug - Axes occasionally don't update in plot window
- Add custom past time

** Histogram View **

- Show gridlines
- Cumulative percentage
- Cumulative distribution
- Probability density
- Add custom past time

** Measurements/Statistics View **

** Automated Control **

- Add ability to step through various curves while changing parameters for an instrument
  with defined min/max range, step size, and step time

** Misc **

- Virtual instruments that do math, generate curves, etc
- Instruments sampling at different rates
- Multi-threading for increased performance, or checking the event queue in
between measurements

** SDL1000 **

- Program mode (and stop on fail)

** SPD **

- Channel 3 indicator and control
- Maybe figure out a way to enable/disable measurements
