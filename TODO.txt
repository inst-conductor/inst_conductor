** General **

- Bugs:
  - Alt+Mouse Wheel does not move the 0.001 digit like it should (known Qt bug)
    Perhaps related to: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-30948

- Enhancements:
  - Convert everything to global style sheets
  - Mouse wheel or up/down arrow should move digit at cursor position like a real instrument
  - Write help for each instrument
  - Add overall README file
  - Look into tab focus order
  - Add buttons to each instrument to open a plotting window or histogram window the
    shows the current measurement

- Major new features:
  - Add ability to step through various curves while changing parameters for an instrument
    with defined min/max range, step size, and step time
    - Add controllable parameters to each instrument (e.g. voltage and current level)
  - Measurement display live spreadsheet
  - Measurement display widgets
  - Virtual instruments that do math, generate curves, etc
  - Implement SDG
  - Implement SDS


** Acquisition **

- Bugs:
  - Closing an instrument doesn't start a new segment so when the instrument is
    reopened it just has a big jump from the previous elapsed time (when there's only
    one instrument).
  - Pausing acquisition still records one additional NaN, which looks odd to the user
    because it looks like the pause hasn't really happened yet

- Enhancements:
  - Real-time save to CSV
    - Put timestamps on measurements in dictionary
  - Replay recording in real time or sped up / slowed down
  - Implement better way to handle breaks between time sequences instead of just inserting
    a dummy NaN. Maybe separate lists of measurements that are then stitched together?
    Right now if there's a segment with only one measurement it isn't drawn.
  - Load from CSV


** XY Plotting **

- Bugs:
  - Sharing Y axis doesn't refresh the position of the Y axis label
  - Axes occasionally don't update in plot window
  - Figure out how to reset Y axes to default
  - When sharing Y axes, figure out what to do with the plot colors not agreeing with the
    axis color

- Enhancements:
  - Add custom past time


** Histogram View **

- Enhancements:
  - Show gridlines
  - Cumulative percentage
  - Cumulative distribution
  - Probability density
  - Add custom past time


** SDL **

- Bugs:
  * Disable all input during refresh()
  * Fix bug where battery report shows up instantly when starting up already in batt mode

- Enhancements:
  - Add progress bar during refresh()
  - SDL make reset test log more obvious when there is something in the log
  - Implement Program mode (and stop on fail)

- Cleanup:
  - Clean up widget init code to have more standardized names


** SPD **

- Bugs:

- Enhancements:
  - Indicate edit of V/A is in progress and not applied to instrument yet (background or
    font)
  - Option to allow live update while changing V/A
  - Option to require Enter to change V/A, not just losing focus
  - Show status message when timer is on if timer display is not shown
  - Channel 3 indicator and control if possible
  - Enable/disable specific measurements
  - Check to see if SPD3303C is has the same controls
    https://siglentna.com/power-supplies/spd3303c-series-programmable-dc-power-supply/
  - Implement support for SPD1168X and SPD1305X
    https://siglentna.com/power-supplies/spd1000x-series-programmable-dc-power-supply/

- Cleanup:
  - Clean up widget init code to have more standardized names


** SDM **

- Bugs:
  * Not all instrument modes are implemented
  * Relative measurements not implemented
  * Setting auto range should grey out range radio buttons

- Enhancements:
  * Put measurements together with their parameters
  * Refresh from instrument: Show warning since it is only updating the first
    configuration and overwriting the others. Also disable other measurements.
  * Add safety interlock for multiple measurements (e.g. no voltage and resistance)
  - Change colors to the side of each set of parameters to they are accessible to
    color-blind people
  - Handle 3045X, 3055, and 3065X with different numbers of digits
