Next tasks:
- Convert everything to global style sheets
- Put instrument prefixes on read/write/query debug messages
- Put timestamps on measurements in dictionary
- SDL make reset test log more obvious when there is something in the log
- Fix closeEvent handler

Cleanup:
- Clean up widget init code to have more standardized names

** General **

- Debug/SCPI command logging to file selectable through menu
- Alt+Mouse Wheel does not move the 0.001 digit like it should (known Qt bug)
- Mouse wheel or up/down arrow should move digit at cursor position like a real instrument
- Look into tab focus
- Write help for each instrument
- Add overall README file
- Add controllable parameters to each instrument (e.g. voltage and current level)

** Acquisition **

- Crash when selecting trigger type
- Change "Elapsed time" to "Logged span" or "Recorded span" or something
- Erase All Data while Paused still records one data point
- Remove border (and maybe background) from Acquiring/Waiting indicator
- Implement better way to handle breaks between time sequences instead of just inserting
  a dummy NaN. Maybe separate lists of measurements that are then stitched together?
  Right now if there's a segment with only one measurement it isn't drawn.
- Bug - Closing an instrument doesn't start a new segment so when the instrument is
  reopened it just has a big jump from the previous elapsed time (when there's only
  one instrument).
- Load from CSV
- Real-time save to CSV
- Replay recording in real time or sped up / slowed down

** XY Plotting **

- Bug - sharing Y axis doesn't refresh the position of the Y axis label
- Bug - Axes occasionally don't update in plot window
- Figure out how to reset Y axes to default
- When sharing Y axes, figure out what to do with the plot colors not agreeing with the
  axis color
- Add custom past time

** Histogram View **

- Show gridlines
- Cumulative percentage
- Cumulative distribution
- Probability density
- Add custom past time

** Measurements/Statistics View **

** Automated Control **

- Add ability to step through various curves while changing parameters for an instrument
  with defined min/max range, step size, and step time

** Misc **

- Virtual instruments that do math, generate curves, etc
- Instruments sampling at different rates
- Multi-threading for increased performance, or checking the event queue in
between measurements

** SDL1000 **

- Disable all input during refresh()
- Fix bug where battery report shows up instantly when starting up already in batt mode
- Program mode (and stop on fail)

** SPD **

- Allow presets and timer to display at the same time
- Shrink delay on long button press for presets
- Indicate edit of V/A is in progress and not applied to instrument yet (background or
  font)
- Option to allow live update while changing V/A
- Option to require Enter to change V/A, not just losing focus
- Show status message when timer is on if timer display is not shown
- Channel 3 indicator and control if possible
- Maybe figure out a way to enable/disable measurements

** SDM **

Siglent Technologies,SDM3055,SDM35FAQ1R1838,1.01.01.25

- Setting auto range should grey out range radio buttons
- Put measurements together with their parameters
- Refresh from instrument: Show warning since it is only updating the first configuration
  and overwriting the others. Also disable other measurements.
- Add safety interlock for multiple measurements (e.g. no voltage and resistance)
- Add better units on display (e.g. VDC or VAC)
- Add sub-units on display (e.g. mVDC or uVDC)
- Change colors to the side of each set of parameters to they are accessible to
  color-blind people
- Handle 3045X, 3055, and 3065X with different numbers of digits?
